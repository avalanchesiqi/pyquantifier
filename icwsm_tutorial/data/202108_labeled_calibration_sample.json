{"text": "Honestly, if people would just stop getting tested. It would be nice. \n\nIf hospitals would stop testing every single person that walks in the door regardless of symptoms, like trauma victims. That would be nice too. \n\nYears ago when the H1N1 was going around and my kid got really sick, they wouldn't even test her at the hospital. (Word was out that it was killing some young and healthy people and I was scared.)  Hospital staff was not about to do that for some reason. They pretty much said she had the flu and that was that. I then realized that she got the same treatment and sent home with the same drugs no matter what a test result would have revealed. Why did I even want to get that test so badly? Went almost full Karen on them for nothing and got put in my place when they were like, \"No, go to an infectious disease specialist or call the health department if you want to do all that.\" I will bet that they didn't have the monetary incentive that covid gives them now. \n\nThat hospital was always a long wait with people in beds all along the hallways. Packed waiting room with some people that looked as if they should have been inside already. Looked just like the fearporn that the media tries to feed us these days. Some hospitals are just that busy most of the time. I know because I spent so much time there when I was caregiver to 3 terminally ill loved ones over a few years. \n\nI look back at that now and feel like I learned something. Don't borrow trouble on account of irrational fear. \n\nI wonder how many doctors and nurses don't speak up about how all this testing is affecting their jobs. It certainly looks like many people can't get the medical care they need now and all because of too much damn testing and fearporn. \n\nImagine if every doctor tested every single person for the flu or a cold and quarantined them, regardless of symptoms. Imagine how that alone would affect the hospitals. \n\nThe testing needs to stop. It is obviously a huge part of the problem. \n\nI have gotten sick a couple times since early 2020 and will never know what it was. If none of this crap was all over the news, would I have seeked medical care for those symptoms? Nope. I was a little scared but didn't want to jump on that train. I stayed home and didn't go running to the huge lines of free testing sites or hospitals where my chances of getting even more sick looked likely.  What is the point? Everyone will wait longer, or die waiting for medical care for all types of illness, all because of covid testing and fearporn.

I don't see any calm heads prevailing if they have another Kargil war and zero chance of the Pakistani government surviving it intact, as that is just the kind of thing the Taliban would start and or exploit to make a play for power.\n\nThe only even remote upside is they are too close to one another for a nuke exchange, but I don't like to say that to loud in case it bites us in the ass.  That and these are not monoliths, Afghanistan and Pakistan are countries full of different ethnic peoples who do not always get along at the best of times.  \n\nThen there is the whole Uyghurs thing.

If they come out too hard on China then they might get fucked on the global scale by Chinas economic regional might.

{"text": "These social media butterfly faeries have never picked up a rifle in their lives, much less used one. And then there my uncle was casually firing an AK into the sky during my mother's wedding in a village in Gujrat. Hell, we keep a few rifles in our home too in the old country, because of the occasional chor daku that have attempted to steal and random every now and then in the past. These  idiots online haven't gone through the same shit. \n\nOne time, our local idiots from our old place threatened to kidnap all the women related to us because of some sort of rejection from a marriage proposal. One of the goons followed my cousin home. My uncle and some of his friends (fauj and police) jumped the dumbarse and beat the shit out of him and then put him in jail, sorted him out real fast. Turned out, he was some local mafia goon with a bit of power (he knew someone who could trace phone calls, has put hits on people in the past). Lucky for us, we have military connections ourselves, he can't fuck with us. I'd like to see them get passed Kharian Cantt (where our house now is). They can't, because the gates are heavily guarded by military personnel. \n\nMy point is, you stand your ground against thugs like these, otherwise they walk all over you. Sometimes, getting a little physical is the only way to do that. Complaining on social media wouldn't have gotten us anywhere. That being said, I've never actually used an AK myself properly. Don't have a registered licence. :P\n\nEdit: I've held and handled the ones we have in our home, but I was never allowed to touch it without supervision, or even use it, because I've never trained in weapons, since i only visit Pakistan annually so I've never had the need to, admittedly.

{"text": "***The vote opens the door for Democrats to use a key legislative maneuver to try to bypass Republican opposition and enact Biden's economic agenda***  \n  \n*BY TONY ROMM*  \n\nHours after the Senate advanced a bipartisan bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure, Democrats forged ahead independently on a second front \u2014 adopting a $3.5 trillion budget that could enable sweeping changes to the nation\u2019s health care, education and tax laws.\n\nThe 50-49 vote came early Wednesday morning, after lawmakers sparred in a marathon debate over the proposed sizable increase in spending and its potential implications for the federal deficit. Its passage marked another critical milestone in Democrats\u2019 complex economic agenda, which includes new public-works investments that Republicans support \u2014 and a slew of additional policy proposals that the GOP does not.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic budget will bring a generational transformation for how our economy works for average Americans,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said after the vote.\n\nChiefly written by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the $3.5 trillion blueprint sets in motion Democrats\u2019 plans to expand Medicare, combat climate change and boost federal safety net programs, including those that target children and low-income parents. It paves the way for universal prekindergarten and new family leave benefits, and it aims to help immigrants obtain legal permanent residency status. Democrats aspire to finance the array of new initiatives through a series tax increases targeting wealthy families and profitable corporations, undoing the rate cuts imposed under President Donald Trump.\n\nLawmakers still must translate their newly adopted budget into fuller legislation, meaning the more difficult fights over its exact contours are set to begin in earnest in September. But its passage still unlocks for Democrats the process known as reconciliation, which will allow them, once ready, to bypass a Republican filibuster in the narrowly divided Senate.\n\nThe display offered a political contrast with the bipartisan celebrations that immediately preceded the debate, as Democrats joined with Republicans in approving a roughly $1 trillion package to improve the country\u2019s roads, bridges, pipes, and ports and Internet connections. But the outcome also reflected an important political reality in Democrat-dominated Washington, where lawmakers led by President Biden have made clear they do not plan to squander their narrow yet powerful majorities after promising to address economic inequality on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor as the debate began, Sanders on Tuesday chided Republicans for \u201cfinding it hard to believe that the president, the Democratic caucus, are prepared to go forward in addressing the long neglected needs of working families and not just the 1 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Sanders soon added, \u201cwe move this country in a very different direction.\u201d\n\nIn adopting the budget, Senate Democrats continued inching Biden\u2019s broader agenda one step closer to the president\u2019s desk. Biden this spring unveiled jobs, infrastructure and families-focused spending plans totaling more than $4 trillion, part of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d approach he adapted from the last election.\n\nDemocrats for months had promised to consider the president\u2019s proposals on \u201ctwo tracks,\u201d in the words of Schumer (D-N.Y.), by seeking a bipartisan solution on infrastructure even as they proceeded on their own to secure Biden\u2019s other priorities through reconciliation. Schumer\u2019s tack essentially helped pressure the often slow-moving chamber into voting on both items in advance of a planned August recess.\n\nBut the coupling of the two spending plans also reflected the simmering tensions within the Democratic caucus, since some party lawmakers see the infrastructure deal as insufficient \u2014 and say they will only vote for it if they can also advance a robust budget that spends sizable sums on areas including climate change.\n\nHouse Democrats have drawn the firmest lines in the sand, a position driven by the 96-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, without which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) cannot move either proposal through the chamber. The caucus led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) reissued its ultimatum on Tuesday, after the Senate adopted the infrastructure bill and began considering the budget.\n\n\u201cOur caucus is clear: the bipartisan bill will only be passed if a package of social, human, and climate infrastructure \u2014 reflecting long-standing Democratic priorities \u2014 is passed simultaneously through budget reconciliation,\u201d Jayapal said in a statement. \u201cWe know that Congressional Democrats are committed to delivering immediate and transformational improvements for the lives of the American people, and will hold firm to meet that promise.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats are not entirely in lockstep on the path ahead. Some moderate lawmakers in the House, for example, do not want to wait for reconciliation to advance infrastructure reform. And centrists in both the House and Senate have questioned the budget\u2019s $3.5 trillion price tag \u2014 as well as the tax increases that might be required for Democrats to cover its costs. Those battles are set to occur in meetings, hearings and floor debates in the weeks to come, making the vote in the Senate the beginning of a much harder, longer fight.\n\nIn doing so, they face an increasing barrage of attacks from Republicans, who say the budget would add to the federal deficit. Taking aim at the proposal in a speech Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, accused Democrats of \u201cputting in motion a government that nobody\u2019s grandchild can ever afford to pay.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s opposition also threatens to spill beyond the budget, as lawmakers led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have said they are unwilling to supply any votes to address the debt ceiling, the statutory limit on how much money the United States government can borrow. McConnell said an increase or suspension of that borrowing limit should be a part of reconciliation, an approach Democrats have opted not to take, putting the Senate on a potential collision course ahead of a key deadline this fall.\n\nReaffirming their stance, a group of 46 Republicans late Tuesday published a public letter saying they would \u201cnot vote to increase the debt ceiling\u201d in any way. \u201cThis is a problem created by Democratic spending,\u201d concluded the letter, whose top signatories included McConnell and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). \u201cDemocrats will have to accept sole responsibility for facilitating it.\u201d\n\nSenate lawmakers still adopted the budget measure after a lengthy debate that allowed lawmakers to offer unlimited, albeit mostly symbolic, amendments \u2014 an inside-Washington process known as a vote-a-rama. The proposals themselves serve as test votes, offering an early gauge for chamber support on key issues \u2014 or political cudgels, which Democrats and Republicans can later weaponize against each other during election season.\n\nBut some of the battles starting Tuesday afternoon also offered crucial insights about the economic policy debates still to come.\n\nOne amendment offered from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), for example, targeted the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, which some Democrats have sought to expand since it was reduced under Trump. The idea generally tends to benefit Americans who live in higher-cost cities, and some party lawmakers have demanded its inclusion as part of the upcoming, fuller reconciliation package.\n\nGrassley\u2019s amendment essentially floated the idea of halting changes to the SALT deduction, but the proposal failed, with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voting against it. The outcome could ease some of the pressure on Democrats as they wade through a series of thorny tax issues later this year.\n\nDemocrats saw potential early trouble in an amendment that broadly addressed Biden\u2019s proposal to change how wealthy heirs pay taxes on large inheritances. Currently, heirs only pay capital gains on increases in the value of properties that occur after they are passed down. Under the president\u2019s plan, however, inheritors also would pay capital gains taxes on increases in the value of property from when they were first acquired by the prior owner. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) joined with Republicans in scuttling the Democrat-offered amendment that sought to serve as a high-level gauge for the idea.", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "h8igyt1", "offense": 8.428414077186024e-50, "perspective_20231224": 0.059479803, "toxic_1_list": [[false, 1196], [false, 1488], [false, 1465], [false, 1458], [false, 1438]]}

The group later circulated a video recording of the execution.\n\nMr. Khorasani said those executed in the video were criminals.\n\nHe said attacks by Islamic State often benefited the Taliban, despite the enmity between the groups. He noted that a prison break in Jalalabad last year, organized by Islamic State and involving four suicide bombers and 11 gunmen, set free hundreds of prisoners from both the Taliban and Islamic State.\n\nA showdown between the Taliban and Islamic State took place in Jowzjan in 2017, Mr. Khorasani said, after a commander with Taliban ties and his fighters swore allegiance to Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They were joined by a militant Uzbek group called the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Together they seized two valleys of the province and raised Islamic State flag over their statelet, Mr. Khorasani said.\n\nThe fighting that he described corresponds with U.S. accounts of the battles, in which the forces of the U.S., the Afghan government and the Taliban crushed Islamic State militants over the course of several months. Hundreds of Islamic State militants surrendered to government forces the following year.\n\nIn Nangarhar, Islamic State was similarly ground down by attacks by the U.S., Afghan government and the Taliban, Mr. Khorasani said. The U.S. dropped what is known as the Mother of All Bombs, or a MOAB, the most powerful conventional bomb in the U.S. military arsenal, to wipe out a Soviet-era cave complex controlled by Islamic State militants.\n\n\n\nThe prison at the National Directorate of Security in Kabul held Mr. Khorasani and Taliban prisoners. Mr. Khorasani was executed when the Taliban took over Kabul.\nPHOTO: VICTOR J. BLUE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\u201cEveryone supported the Taliban one way or another against us,\u201d Mr. Khorasani said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret why they began to win.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. said at the time that it killed more than 90 militants including several commanders in the bombing of the cave complex. Mr. Khorasani disputed that, saying the complex was evacuated at the time.\n\nThe rise of Islamic State as a new international enemy furthered the Taliban\u2019s global diplomatic efforts, boosting a group that for years had sought to scrub itself of a terrorist taint, according to former officials of the U.S.-backed Afghan government.\n\nThe U.S. offered the Taliban international recognition by opening negotiations in Doha that led to the release last year of 5,000 inmates from Afghan prisons. Many of those former detainees flocked to the battlefield, strengthening Taliban forces, former Afghan government officials said.\n\nAs part of the agreement reached in Doha, the Taliban promised to prevent militant groups from attacking the West.\n\nMr. Khorasani said he left Nangarhar last year as the remnants of Islamic State fighters dispersed inside Afghanistan. He was arrested by U.S. and Afghan forces in a house outside Kabul in May 2020.\n\nA judge sentenced him to death and 800 years in prison, he said.

{"text": ">It is worth considering some counterfactuals for how our occupation could have ended. Imagine that the Biden administration, believing the Afghan government hollow, ignored President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s pleas and begins rapidly withdrawing personnel and power months ago.

Those who didn\u2019t know which side to choose, who were waiting for a signal of who held power, quickly cut deals with the Taliban. As the last U.S. troops leave, the Taliban overwhelms the country, and the Biden administration is blamed, reasonably, for speeding their victory.\n\n>Another possible scenario was suggested to me by Grant Gordon, a political scientist who works on conflict and refugee crises (and is, I should say, an old friend): If the Biden administration had pulled our allies and personnel out more efficiently, that might have unleashed the Taliban to massacre their opposition, as America and the world would have been insulated and perhaps uninterested in the aftermath. There have been revenge killings, but it has not devolved, at least as of yet, into all-out slaughter, and that may be because the American withdrawal has been messy and partial and the Taliban fears re-engagement. \u201cWhat is clearly a debacle from one angle may actually have generated restraint.

{"text": "The documents that Blizzard isn't handing over are related to complaints that were raised with a lawyer who was under employ of Blizzard. Communications with a lawyer are strictly privileged. That privilege extends to all parties, complainant (employee in this case), counsel, and employer. No one is obligated to divulge confidential information when it is said in a legal meeting with a lawyer. California is trying to break that confidence.\n\nAnother piece of their complaint is based on the use of NDAs to shield outside settlements. Individuals have the right to settle *without* California. There's no obligation to the collective in the US or California, they're legally allowed to work with ActiBlizz to settle and sign an NDA as a part of that. The NDAs being signed limit those who settle to being able to speak only to immediate family - in CA that is parents, children, grandparents - counsel, or other professional advisors. I get not liking this, but no one owes California, and if Blizzard makes a settlement with an individual to make recompense and/or rectify the wrong in a way that that individual feels is appropriate, that's actually a good thing. NDAs are civil agreements. They actually don't harm the people signing them, through whistleblower laws, first amendment rights, and a number of other avenues, you can still disclose that information. What NDAs *do* protect you against is government overreach requiring you to release information related to it. These NDAs essentially require the complainant to allow the respondent to attempt to keep the events private. \n\nWhy does that NDA matter? Well, it's possible the complainant doesn't want the information to become public as part of a state civil suit, but would like to seek remedy. It's entirely reasonable to not want future employers to know you wanted to settle either. There are many, many reasons that someone might prefer this to a state action.\n\nIf you want more info, Hoeg Law had an extremely thorough breakdown on his YouTube channel that goes through the *actual* document. I suggest checking that out, and the series so far of you're wanting to understand this as a legal case and not just a public scandal.\n\nNone of this, of course, is in the shitty clickbait article. You have to actually read the complaint that was filed by California.\n\nEdit, fixed a few words.

{"text": "Biden finally says Cuomo should resign hours after blistering harassment report\n\nPresident Biden on Tuesday called on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign after an official report found that he sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n\u201cI think he should resign,\u201d Biden said of his longtime Democratic ally.\n\nBiden spoke hours after Cuomo proclaimed his innocence and issued a counter-report with photos of Biden and other elected officials hugging women.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to flyspeck this. I\u2019m sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent. But apparently the attorney general decided there were things that weren\u2019t,\u201d Biden said when a reporter asked about Cuomo using his own conduct as a defense.\n\nBiden himself has faced allegations of making women feel uncomfortable with unwanted touching and he has denied a sexual assault allegation from former Senate aide Tara Reade.\n\nBiden did not weigh in on whether the New York state Legislature should impeach Cuomo \u2014 or if the governor should face criminal charges. He also confirmed he hadn\u2019t spoken on Tuesday with the three-term Democrat.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo should resign.\nPresident Joe Biden said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo should resign.\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh\n\u201cI understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don\u2019t know that for a fact,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden said in March that Cuomo should step down if a probe commissioned by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a fellow Democrat, concluded that the governor was guilty.\n\nJames on Tuesday released the findings of her office\u2019s investigation, which corroborated allegations of inappropriate remarks and touching by Cuomo.\n\nABC News host George Stephanopoulos asked Biden in March, \u201cIf the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, I think he\u2019ll probably end up being prosecuted too,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nBiden did not offer further comment Tuesday on whether Cuomo should be prosecuted, drawing a rebuke from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), the No. 3 ranking House Republican.\n\nStefanik said in a statement that \u201cPresident Biden is reversing course, stopping short of calling for Governor Cuomo to be prosecuted or impeached. President Biden\u2019s response to the AG\u2019s report makes him complicit in the crimes committed by sexual predator Governor Cuomo.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Vice President Kamala Harris had not demanded Cuomo\u2019s resignation \u2014 making her one of the only high-profile national Democrats not to do so. Her office hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment from The Post.\n\nA probe from the New York State Attorney General found that Gov. Cuomo sexually harassed several women.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the allegations against Cuomo are \u201cabhorrent.\u201d\n\nMost members of New York\u2019s congressional delegation, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and leftwing leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called for Cuomo to resign in March as allegations mounted against him.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday called for Cuomo to resign. Pelosi previously said he should step down \u201cif these allegations are proven to be true.\u201d\n\nPelosi said in a new statement, \u201cAs always, I commend the women who came forward to speak their truth. Recognizing his love of New York and the respect for the office he holds, I call upon the Governor to resign.\u201d \n\nCuomo angrily pleaded his innocence on Tuesday afternoon, saying that he didn\u2019t intend to make anyone feel uncomfortable with awkward personal remarks and that \u201cI never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.\u201d\n\nCuomo also insisted he wasn\u2019t harassing women by touching their face and kissing them. \u201cI do it with everyone \u2014 black and white, young and old, straight and LGBTQ, powerful people, friends, strangers, people who I meet on the street,\u201d Cuomo said.", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "h7lzvm1", "offense": 7.16071693293388e-08, "perspective_20231224": 0.28857216, "toxic_1_list": [[false, 1325], [false, 1333], [false, 1076], [false, 1338], [false, 728]]}

Its deceptive however and would make any reasonable person question the motives of the FDA and why they would do this for Pfizer and would willingly deceive the citizens they are supposed to protect.

The more likely you are to use the insurance, the higher your premiums are. But that's not how it works with Delta Airlines now, or many other places for that matter, because obese people end up paying the same rates as people who hit the gym 5 days per week. Obese people end up taking way more out of that pool than could rationally be argued for unvaccinated non obese people. Again Obese people are more likely to be hospitalized over COVID than healthy people, even if they are vaccinated. That is why this is wrong. If we are going to pay our risk, lets pay our risk. I would pay a representational cost of risk due to being unvaccinated, and all the obese people would pay a more substantial amount (because of the likelihood to draw more out of that pool based on risk).

It's also ironic that on 21/07/2021 journalists found out that the government gave approval \r\nto build wind farms in Eyboia and more specific in the municipality of Mantoudiou(the area which is burning)(to find the document, go on the website \u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 and write 504/21  2021 \u039d\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 \u0395\u03a5\u0392\u039f\u0399\u0391\u03a3 \u0394\u0397\u039c\u039f\u03a3 \u039c\u0391\u039d\u03a4\u039f\u03a5\u0394\u0399\u039f\u03a5 \u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7 \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0386\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 and choose the first option, it's a government website). We fight and we fight alone. It's not a symptom that every time people see the camera say scr** you Mhtsotakhs or Mhtsotakhs you get f.....\r\nInstead of passing a law saying, even if a woodland gets burned, you can't build there. And then after Mhtsotakhs burn the land he saw that his popularity fall massively and said, we will make reforestation areas the areas that were burnt(after he chose to burn them...).It's also not a symptom that EVERY SINGLE summer areas with forests in Greece are getting burnt and after years(3 is the most usual) we see wind farms build there. And the plan of Mhtotakhs even now is for the people that live there where the fire is, it's to evacuate their homes and properties. AND WHERE SHOULD THEY GO I ASK? WHERE? Those people that chose to evacuate and the government promised them hotels, let them all together sleeping in tents, vultures while we live with the fear of covid-19. So most people end up becoming firefighters and many times managing to save their villages..+Mhtsotakhs fired 5066 forest protectors(-rangers) and we had 80 fire different places that the fire began(not a symptom.", "platform": "youtube", "platform_id": "UgzNwHYj_W2ieI9WaIt4AaABAg", "offense": 0.9752718509945927, "perspective_20231224": 0.16158698, "toxic_1_list": [[false, 2503], [false, 2467], [false, 2497], [false, 2506], [false, 2589]]}

There are so many trivial  other things that you have to have an I'd for. If you live in America EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF HAVING AN ID  Even when you die your family members must show your I'd. The only time you don't  need an I'd is to cheat and lie. Oh to buy alchohol  guess what I'd.  Please tell me how having an I'd is racist on minorities.  Every minority  child or really  any child is their dream to get a driver's license  and that is called an I'd.   Even poor white people know how to get an I'd. It's a shame that a group of rich entitled  politicians  can tell another group that they are not smart enough to know how to get an I'd or go to kinko's and make a copy  AND STILL FOLLOW THEIR RASIST  POLITICIANS  AND VOTE FOR THEM.

Long before covid, soooo many parents would send their kids to school when they KNEW the kids were sick. That got my kids sick and they'd bring it home to me. They'd get over it fast but I would be sick literally from oct 1st to June every year when they were in elementary.  I don't get colds, I get pneumonia. Why do ppl think they have a right to spread their damn diseases everywhere?! Ppl will come into my shop hacking their guts out. When I ask what they have, they'll usually say \"oh, it's just a chest cold \". To them it's nothing, to me it's 3 months of antibiotics.  Stay home and keep your damn kids home when you and they are sick. I don't go around ppl when I'm sick and I always kept my kids home the instant I knew they were contagious. Cuz I have ethics and morals and I know it's not my constitutional right to spread my kids' diseases around. Ppl have been selfish, entitled brats long before covid. I'd love to see those 3 women try to home school. They so fit the profile of parents who don't do any education with their kids at home. Probably don't even read to their kids. These were the typical moms whose kids came to kindergarten not knowing their alphabet, how to read simple sentences, how to tie their shoes etc. They use the schools as full time babysitters and are the first to gripe and moan. And another hypocrisy of most parents- they'll bring their kids to bar restaurants and chug beer and wine and drive home in front of their kids but complain about masks.

And He was first kicked out of public schools by eliminating prayer there under the guise of being forced religion. Of course, classrooms today are being remodeled into Muslim prayer rooms because it's not forcing religion on everyone else,  everyone else is just being  bigoted, racist, and intolerant if they don't like it. Since then, His Ten Commandments displays were taken away from courts of law, and so on . . . \n\nSo I'm not sure where you heard America is a Christian nation. Even Obama said it no longer was.\n\nSo, yeah, He must just not care that we're obviously a Christian nation since He's not helping.

{"text": "Believe the Gospel, Preach the Gospel, Teach the Gospel. Save as many as possible. Don\u2019t miss out and go through the great tribulation when you can be saved and out of this place and forever with the Lord Jesus Christ. \u201cMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.\n\nThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?\n\nI protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.\n\nThe sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\u201d\n\u202d\u202d1 Corinthians\u202c \u202d15. \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udfba", "platform": "youtube", "platform_id": "UgzAXttSjOAndADgcG14AaABAg", "offense": 3.7236256462733154e-11, "perspective_20231224": 0.038991302, "toxic_1_list": [[false, 28], [false, 562], [false, 23], [false, 800], [false, 802]]}
